# Frontend Simulator

This directory contains a simple HTML frontend for simulating API calls to Chronos Atlas.

- `frontend_simulator.html`: Demo interface for testing GraphQL and REST endpoints.

See the main [README](../README.md) and [Detailed Documentation](../docs/README_DETAILED.md) for API usage and setup.
